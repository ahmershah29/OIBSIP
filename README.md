This repo showcases my 1-month Oasis Web Development Internship projects, where I worked on building responsive websites and dynamic web applications. Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, and APIs, I developed both frontend and backend skills. Check out my work and connect with me on LinkedIn.
